# Ideas for future features :100:

#### Boss wave. Every x wave, spawns a boss that has more health and maybe certain abilities.

- spawn mobs on every hit he takes (could be death animation of the mob reversed)
- spawn mobs on every x seconds
- spawn mobs on death
- destroy random tower on death
- freeze the tower he got hit from by x seconds
- skeleton shield that blocks projectiles every x seconds

- tower which dont shot projectiles but instead have a range and damage and every enemy in range gets damaged

- some towers could only available after a condition. e.g. after x waves or after x (Boss)kills

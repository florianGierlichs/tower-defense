# Welcome to HERO TOWER DEFENSE

A simple tower defense game only made with TypeScript and HTML5 Canvas. There is no game engine used. Every logic is custom written.

I did this to learn about game development and how far I can go with my web-development skills.

The game is in an early stage with limited features. I have a lot [ideas](https://github.com/florianGierlichs/tower-defense/blob/main/ideas.md) of what I want to add to the game. But I don't know if I will ever find the time to do so.

If you have any kind of feedback or want to [report a bug](https://github.com/florianGierlichs/tower-defense/issues), please let me know. I would love to hear from you.

## Play the game

You can play the current deployed version [here](https://floriangierlichs.github.io/tower-defense/).

`https://floriangierlichs.github.io/tower-defense/`

## How to play

The goal of the game is to defend your HP from the incoming enemy waves. You can place towers on the map to shoot the enemies.

For each kill you granted with a bounty, after each wave your gold increases.

## Development

The application is running as simple vite-typescript project. If you want to run the application locally just clone the repo, install the dependencies and run `npm run dev` to start the local development server.
